## Hidden Unreleased Module
There is one additional hidden module that is not yet ready to be released. But you can enable it by editing the  
\<Rack user folder\>/Plugins/VenomModules/plugin.json file. Find the hidden module within the file, and change the "hidden" value to false. But bear in mind that this module may never be released, and may disappear entirely from a future release. Or if it is released, it may not be backward compatible with the current hidden version.

## Themes
The context menu of every module includes options to set the default theme for the Venom plugin, as well as a theme override for each module instance. There are 4 themes to choose from.

|Ivory|Coal|Earth|Danger|
|---|---|---|---|
|![Ivory theme image](./doc/Ivory.png)|![Coal theme image](./doc/Coal.png)|![Earth theme image](./doc/Earth.png)|![Danger theme image](./doc/Danger.png)|

## Parameter Locks
Nearly every parameter (module knob, switch, or button etc.) within the Venom plugin has its own parameter context menu option to lock the paramenter. In addition, most modules have module context menu options to lock and unlock all parameters within that instance of the module.

The display name includes "(locked)" when hovering over a locked parameter.

The parameter value cannot be changed by any means while the parameter is locked. All of the normal means of changing a parameter value are blocked:
- The parameter cannot be dragged or pushed
- Context menu value keyins are ignored
- Double click and context menu initialization are ignored
- Preset changes are ignored
- Randomization requests are ignored

Parameter lock settings are saved with the patch and restored upon patch load. Parameter lock settings are also preserved when duplicating a module.

## BERNOULLI SWITCH
![Bernoulli Switch module image](./doc/BernoulliSwitch.PNG)  
The Bernoulli Switch randomly routes two inputs to two outputs.

### General Operation
Upon receiving a trigger or gate, a virtual coin toss determines if input A goes to output A and B to B (no-swap), or if A goes to B and B to A (swap). Each input can be attenuated and/or inverted by a bipolar SCALE knob ranging from -1 to 1, and offset by an OFFSET knob, ranging from -10 to 10. The A input is normalled to the TRIG input and the B input is normalled to 0V, so if both inputs are left unpatched, the Bernoulli Switch will function as a "traditional" Bernoulli Gate. A "latched" mode may be achieved by leaving the B input at 0V and setting the A input SCALE to 0 and the A OFFSET to 10V.

### Probability
The PROB knob and PROB input determine the probability that a particular routing operation will occur. If there is no PROB input, then a fully counterclockwise PROB knob yields a 0% chance of the the routing operation, and fully clockwise is 100% chance. The range is linear, with 50% at noon. The probability can be modulated by bipolar PROB input, with each volt equating to 10% chance.

### Routing Operation or Mode
The actual routing operation is controlled by the unlabeled 3 position sliding switch, with the following possible values:
- **TOGGLE**: The probability is the chance that the routing will toggle from the current routing to the opposite. If currently swapped, then a positive result will switch to un-swapped. If currently unswapped, then a positive result will switch to swapped. A negative result yields no change.
- **SWAP**: The probabiliy is the chance that the routing will be set to swapped, regardless of the current routing. A positive result yields a swapped routing, a negative result yields a no-swap routing. 
- **GATE**: The routing is always in a swap configuration whenever the TRIG input is low. Upon transition to high, a positive coin toss results in a no-swap routing throughout the TRIG high state. A negative result remains in a swap configuration.

### Triggers
The module generally responds to a leading edge transition from low to high of the TRIG input or the manual TRIG button. The TRIG button works by adding 10V to the TRIG input.

The RISE knob sets the threshold for a trigger transition to high, and the FALL knob sets the threshold for a transition to low. By default the RISE is set to 1V, and the FALL to 0.1V. If currently low, then a TRIG input >= the RISE threshold transistions to HIGH. The input remains high until the input falls below the FALL threshold, upon which it returns to a low state.

If the RISE threshold is less than the FALL threshold, then the roles are reversed, and the Bernoulli Switch is triggered by a trailing transition from high to low. If using GATE mode, the routing will always have a swap configuration whenever the input is high, and the configuration may switch to no-swap upon transition to low.

The TRIG button is not guaranteed to always trigger a coin toss - it depends on how the RISE and FALL are configured, as well as the current TRIG input value.

### Polyphony
Bernoulli Switch is fully polyphonic. There are two modes available from the context menu that determine how many virtual coin tosses are performed based on the number of channels on each input:
- **TRIG and PROB only** (default)

  The number of coin flips is the maximum channel count found across the TRIG and PROB inputs. If one of the inputs is monophonic, and the other polyphonic, then the monophonic input is replicated to match the channel count of the polyphonic input. If a polyphonic input is missing channels, then the missing channels are treated as 0V.

  If the coin flip count is 1 (both TRIG and PROB are mono), then polyphonic inputs to A and/or B are treated as a whole - all of the channels on the A input are directed to either the A or B output. The same for the B input. If either A or B input has fewer channels than the other, then the missing channels are made up with 0V so that A and B always send the same number of channels.

  But if either of TRIG or PROB are poly, resulting in multiple coin flips, then each coin flip is applied to the appropriate channels in A and B inputs. This can result in A and B input channels being scrambled across the A and B outputs. Monophonic A and/or B inputs are replicated to match the coin flip channel count. Missing channels in polyphonic A and/or B are treated as 0V. Extra input channels in A or B are ignored.

- **All inputs**

  The number of coin flips is the maximum channel count found across all four inputs - TRIG, PROB, A, and B. Monophonic inputs are replicated to match the maximum channel count. Polyphonic channels with missing channels treat the missing channel as 0V.
  
  Polphonic inputs in A and/or B can always be scrambled across A and B outputs.

A small LED between the INPUT ports glows yellow when polyphony detection is configured for "All inputs". The LED is off (black) when configured for "TRIG and PROB only".

### Active Route Monitoring
A pair of yellow lights indicate the current routing configuration. A yellow light glowing to the left of the PROB knob indicates a no-swap configuration. A glowing yellow light to the right indicates a swap configuration.

The yellow lights only monitor a single channel - by default they monitor channel one. The context menu has a Monitor Channel option to switch to a different channel. If the monitored channel is Off, or greater than the number of coin flip channels, then the yellow lights will remain dark - no monitoring will be done.

### Audio Processing
By default Bernoulli Switch is configured for switching gates or CV signals, but it can also process audio signals. If you switch audio at slow rates you may get unwanted pops. If you switch audio at audio rates then you may get unwanted aliasing. The module context menu has Audio Process options to reduce or eliminate these artifacts: Antipop crossfade for slow switching, and various oversampling options for audio rate switching. A small LED between the OUTPUT ports glows red when Anti-Pop Switching is in effect, and blue when any of the oversampling options is enabled. The LED is off (black) when the Audio Process is set to Off (the default).

### Factory Presets
The following factory presets are available that emulate the four configurations available to the Mutable Instruments Branches module:
- Bernoulli Gate - Sends triggering gate to A or B
- Latched Bernoulli Gate - Sends constant 10V to either A or B
- Latched Toggled Bernoulli Gate - Toggles constant 10V between A and B
- Toggled Bernoulli Gate - Toggles triggering gate between A and B

### Parameter Locking
All parameters may be locked

### Bypass Behavior
If Bernoulli Switch is bypassed then the A input is passed unchanged to the A output, and likewise the B input to the B output. However, the A input is not normalled to the TRIG input while bypassed.

## CLONE MERGE
![Clone Merge module image](./doc/CloneMerge.png)  
Clone Merge clones up to 8 monophonic inputs and merges the resultant channels into a single polyphonic output. It is especially useful with the Recurse modules when using polyphonic inputs. Clone Merge provides a convenient way to replicate CV inputs to match the recursion count.

### CLONE knob
Selects the number of times to clone or replicate each input. Possible values range from 1 to 16.

### MONO inputs
The 8 monophonic inputs should be populated from top to bottom. Each input is replicated based on the Clone count as long as the total channel count across all replicated inputs does not exceed 16. Inputs that cannot be replicated the full amount are ignored.

An LED glows yellow for each input that is successfully replicated. The LED glows red if the input cannot be replicated. Unpatched inputs below the last patched input are ignored and the corresponding LED is off (black).

### POLY output
All of the replicated inputs are merged into the single polyphonic output. The poly output starts with all clones from input 1, followed by clones from input 2, etc.

### Bypass

If Clone Merge is bypassed then the output is constant monophonic 0V.

## Harmonic Quantizer
![Harmonic Quantizer module image](./doc/HQ.PNG)  
Computes a selected harmonic or subharmonic partial relative to a fundamental root V/Oct, or quantizes an input V/Oct to the nearest partial relative to the root.

This module is fully polyphonic. The number of output channels is the maximum channel count found across all three inputs. Any monophonic input is replicated to match the output channel count. A polyphonic input with fewer channels uses 0V for any missing channels.

### Digital Display (unlabled)
Displays the integral partial number that is currently being output for a single channel. A yellow value indicates a positive value, representing a true partial from the natural harmonic series. A red value indicates a negative value, representing a subharmonic.

By default the display monitors channel 1. A different channel may be selected via the module context menu. The display will be blank if the selected channel is Off, or greater than the number of output channels.

### Harmonic Series switch (unlabled)
Selects one of three possible series
- **A** = All partials -  (default)
- **O** = Odd partials
- **E** = Even partials (includes the fundamental partial, even though it is odd)

The output will be constrained to the selected series.

### Partial knob
Selects a single integral partial number. By default the range is from 1 (fundamental) to 16 (4 octaves above the fundamental). The context menu allows selection of any one of the following ranges:
- 1 to 16 (default)
- 1 to 32
- 1 to 64
- 1 to 128
- -16 to 1
- -32 to 1
- -64 to 1
- -128 to 1
- -16 to 16
- -32 to 32
- -64 to 64
- -128 to 128

Negative values refer to subharmonics. There is no 0 partial, and both -1 and 1 refer to the same fundamental root. So both 0 and -1 are skipped within the sequence of allowable values. 

### CV knob and input
The bipolar CV input modulates the selected partial, adding or subtracting 1 partial for every 0.1 volt. The CV input is attenuated and/or inverted by the CV knob. The resultant partial is clamped to within the currently active Partial range. Keep in mind that 0 and -1 are skipped when computing the end result, so a knob value of -2 + 0.1 volt modulation yields 1, not -1.

The Partial knob, CV knob, and CV input are all ignored if the IN input is patched (although the CV input can still modify the number of output channels).

### ROOT input
Establishes the fundamental V/Oct value (1st partial)

### IN input
If this port is patched, then the V/Oct input is quantized to the nearest harmonic or subharmonic partial relative to the ROOT input. The computation is clamped to within +/- 128 partials (+/- 7 octaves). The Partial knob, CV knob, and CV input are all ignored when quantizing IN input.

### OUT output
The final computed partial is converted into a delta V/Oct and added to the ROOT to establish the final output V/Oct value.

### Bypass

The IN input is passed unchanged to the OUT output when the Harmonic Quantizer is bypassed.

## MIX 4
![Mix 4 module image](./doc/Mix4.png)  
A compact polyphonic audio or CV mixer, attenuator, inverter, amplifier, and/or offset with optional hard or soft (saturation) clipping.

### Level knobs and inputs 1 - 4
These knobs control the level of each of the input channels before they are summed to create the Mix. The exact behavior depends on the setting of the Mode button.
Each input level knob may produce constant CV if the corresponding input is unpatched, depending on the mode.

### MIX level knob and output
The MIX knob controls the level of the final mix after summing the 4 modified inputs. The behavior depends on the setting of the Mode button. The final result may be clipped, depending on the clip setting, before being sent to the MIX output.

### Polyphony
The number of output polyphonic channels is normally determined by the maximum number of channels found across all four inputs. Monophonic inputs are replicated to match the number of output channels. But polyphonic inputs with fewer channels send 0V for any missing channels.

The one exception is when using the "Unipolar audio dB poly sum" mode, in which case all polyphonic channels are summed to a monophonic output.

### M (Level Mode) button
The color coded mode button determines how the 4 channel and the mix knobs behave. The mode button cycles through 5 possible modes. The button context menu allows direct selection of any mode. Each mode is labeled for audio or CV according to the most typical application, but all modes can be applied to either audio or CV.
- **Unipolar audio dB** (pink - default): Each knob ranges from -inf dB (0V) to +6.0206 dB (x2 amplification), with the default of 0 dB (unity) at noon. Unpatched inputs contribute constant 0V.
- **Unipolar audio dB poly sum** (purple): Same as Unipolar audio dB, except polyphonic inputs are summed to a single monophonic signal before being attenuated or amplified by the input level knob.
- **Bipolar CV%** (green): Each input level knob ranges from -100% (inversion) to 100% (unity) if the input is patched, or -10V to 10V constant CV when unpatched. Each input level knob defaults to 0% (or 0V) at noon. The Mix knob always ranges from -100% to 100%, with a default of 100%.
- **Bipolar CV x2** (light blue): Each input level knob ranges from -2x to 2x if the input is patched, or -10V to 10V constant CV when unpatched. Each input level knob defaults to 0x (or 0V) at noon. The Mix knob always ranges from -2x to 2x, with a default of 1x (unity).
- **Bipolar CV x10** (dark blue): Each input level knob ranges from -10x to 10x if the input is patched, or -10V to 10V constant CV when unpatched. Each input level knob defaults to 0% (or 0V) at noon. The Mix knob always ranges from -10x to 10x, with a default of 1x (unity).

### C (Clip) button
The color coded clip button determines how (or if) the final output is clipped. Clipping occurs after the final mix is attenuated (or amplified) by the Mix level knob. The clipping options are labeled as CV or audio according to typical usage, but each option can be used for audio or CV.
- **Off** (dark gray): The final mix is left untouched, with no limit to the output voltage.
- **Hard CV clipping** (white): The final mix is hard clipped at +/-10V. This can produce significant aliasing if applied to audio signals.
- **Soft audio clipping** (yellow): The final mix is soft clipped at +/-10V with saturation using an approximated tanh function. At moderate saturation levels there is little to no audible aliasing. But very hot signals can still lead to significant aliasing.
- **Soft oversampled CV audio clipping** (orange): The final mix is soft clipped at +/-10V with saturation using an oversampled approximated tanh function. This uses significantly more CPU, but also greatly reduces or eliminates any audible audio aliasing that would otherwise occur.

### Bypass

The MIX output is monophonic 0V if MIX 4 is bypassed.

## MIX 4 STEREO
![Mix 4 Stereo module image](./doc/Mix4Stereo.png)  
A stereo compact polyphonic audio or CV mixer, attenuator, inverter, amplifier, and/or offset with optional hard or soft (saturation) clipping.

Mix 4 Stereo is identical to Mix 4 except each of the inputs and outputs is doubled to support left and right channels. A single input level knob controls each stereo input pair, and a single Mix level knob controls the stereo output pair.

Each right input is normaled to the corresponding left input. When in CV mode, each input level knob produces constant CV only if both the left and right input are unpatched.

The number of polyphonic output channels is determined by the maximum polyphonic channel count found across all inputs. The output channel count always matches for the left and right Mix outputs.

When Mix 4 Stereo is bypassed, both the left and right Mix outputs are monophonic constant CV.

All other behaviors are the same as for Mix 4.

## POLY CLONE
![Poly Clone module image](./doc/PolyClone.png)  
Poly Clone replicates each channel from a polyphonic input and merges the result into a single polyphonic output. It is especially useful with the Recurse modules when using polyphonic inputs. Poly Clone provides a convenient way to replicate channels in polyphonnic CV inputs to match the recursion count.

### CLONE knob
Selects the number of times to clone or replicate each input channel. Possible values range from 1 to 16.

### POLY input
Each channel from the polyphonic input is replicated based on the Clone count as long as the total replicated channel count does not exceed 16. Channels that cannot be replicated the full amount are ignored.

No input is treated as monophonic constant 0V.

For each channel appearing at the input, the corresponding LED above glows yellow if the channel could be successfully replicated, and red if it could not be replicated. LEDs beyond the input channel count remain off (black).

### POLY output
All of the replicated channels are merged into the single polyphonic output. The poly output starts with all clones from input channel 1, followed by clones from input channel 2, etc.

### Bypass

If Clone Merge is bypassed then the input is passed unchanged to the output.

[Return to Table Of Contents](#venom)

## RECURSE
![RECURSE module image](./doc/Recurse.PNG)  
Uses polyphony to recursively process an input via SEND and RETURN up to 16 times. Polyphonic inputs may be used, which will limit the number of recursion passes to less than 16 for each input channel. There are no limits placed on any of the input or output voltages.

### Recursion Count knob and display

Specifies how many recursion passes should be applied to each input channel. The input channel count mulitiplied by the recursion count must be less than or equal to 16, else some input channels will be dropped.

The display is yellow if all input channels can recurse the requested number of times. The display is red if one or more input channels is dropped.

### Input and Output

The Input is the signal to be recursively processed, and the result is sent to the Output. The number of output channels will match the input unless channels had to be dropped due to channel count limitations during send and return.

### Send and Return

The Send output and Return input channel count can be computed as input channels multiplied by recursion count. The maximum number of input channels is the integral division of 16 divided by recursion count. Input channels that exceed the computed maximum are dropped.

If there are 3 input channels and a recursion count of 5, then Send/Return channels 1-5 will be for input channel 1, 6-10 for input channel 2, and 11-15 for input channel 3. If the recursion count is bumped up to 6 while the input channel count remains 3, then Send/Return channels 1-6 are assigned to channel 1, 7-12 channel 2, and channel 3 is dropped because there are not enough channels remaining to complete 6 recursive passes.

The Return input is normalled to the Send output.

### Internal Modulation

Inputs can be recursively scaled and offset within the RECURSE module itself.

The SCALE input and knob value are multiplied to establish the scale factor. The scale factor is then multiplied by the input value, so RECURSE can perform ring modulation.

The OFFSET input and knob value are added to establish the offset that is added to the input.

By default, the SCALE operation occurs before the OFFSET operation. A context menu option lets you choose to peform the OFFSET before SCALE. A small light glows yellow next to the operation that is performed first.

The SCALE and OFFSET inputs support polyphony. However, only channels that correspond to what appears on the IN input will be used, extra channels will be ignored. Each SCALE or OFFSET channel will be applied to all relevant recursive steps for the corresponding IN input.

The unlabeled Modulation Mode knob determines when the SCALE and OFFSET operations take place. There are 4 values:
- **1Pre** = Once before the first Send only
- **nPre** = Before every recursive Send
- **nPost** = After every recursive Return
- **1Post** = Once after the final Return

Since the Return is normalled to the Send, it is possible to generate a polyphonic series of constant voltages using only the RECURSE module. For example, leave all inputs and the Return unpatched, set the Recursion Count to 16, the Scale to 1, the Offset to 1V, and the Mode to nPre. The SEND output will have 16 channels of integral values from 1 to 16. Change the Mode to nPost and the values will range from 0 to 15.

#### Bypass

The Input is passed unchanged to the Output when RECURSE is bypassed. The SEND will be monophonic 0V.

[Return to Table Of Contents](#venom)

## RECURSE STEREO
![Recurse Stereo module image](./doc/RecurseStereo.PNG)  
Recurse Stereo is identical to [Recurse](#recurse) except the Input/Return inputs and Output/Send outputs are doubled to support left and right channels of a stereo pair.

The number of input polyphonic channels is strictly controlled by the Left Input. Any extra channels in the Right Input are ignored.

The Right Input is normalled to the Left Input.

In addition, The Left Return is normalled to the Left Send, and the Right Return is normalled to the Right Send.

The Recursion Count, Scale, Offset, and Modulation Timing settings are applied to both Left and Right identically.

Both left and right inputs are passed unchanged to the outputs when RECURSE STEREO is bypassed. Bypassed left and right send are monophonic 0V.

## Rhythm Explorer
![Rhythm Explorer module image](./doc/RhythmExplorer.PNG)  
Rhythm Explorer is a trigger sequencer that randomly generates repeating patterns on demand. It is heavily inspired by the Vermona randomRHYTHM Eurorack module, though no attempt was made to exactly replicate that module's features.

### Basic Operation
Rhythm Explorer looks complicated, but it is very simple to quickly begin creating interesting rhythms. Starting from the default initial settings, patch a 24 ppqn clock into the CLOCK input, and patch any combination of the GATEs, OR, XOR ODD, or XOR 1 outputs to your favorite drum modules. Adjust some of the sliders to something greater than 0, but less than 100, and press the RUN button. A repeating rhythm should emerge, which can be modulated by adjusting the sliders. Each time you press the DICE button you will get a brand new pattern that can be modulated via the sliders.

### Basic Principles
Random Rhythm uses a pseudo Random Number Generator (RNG) to establish a sequence of seemingly random numbers. However, the "random" sequence is dictated by a seed number - every time the RNG is reseeded with the same number, it generates the exact same sequence. With the initial setup, the reseed occurs after each set of 4 quarter notes, thus establishing a pattern. When the DICE button is pressed, a new seed number is generated, so the pattern will change.

Each division has its own density slider ranging from 0 to 100%, and each division also gets its own sequence of "random" numbers. Assuming all divisions are set to All mode, then when the slider value is greater than the current random number for that division, then the high gate will be issued for that beat. If the density is at 100%, then all beats will be played. If at 0%, then no beats will be played. The values in between do not specify the precise density for any given pattern, but rather specify the average frequency across all possible patterns.

### Triggers and Gates
All trigger and gate inputs have a transition to high threshold of 2 volts and transition to low threshold of 0.1 volts.

Trigger and gate high outputs are 10 volts, and low outputs 0 volts.

### CLOCK Input
The Rhythm Explorer will not run properly until a 24 ppqn (pulses per quarter note) clock is patched into the CLOCK input.

### RUN
If the RUN input is not patched, then every press of the RUN button will toggle the run state on or off. The RUN button will be brightly lit while running, and off (actually very dimly lit) when not running.

Alternatively, the module run status can be controlled by patching CV into the RUN input. A high gate turns the run status on, and a low gate off. Again, the RUN light indicates the run status. When controlled by CV, the RUN button becomes momentary, and inverts the current run status. If currently running, then pressing the RUN button stops the module for as long as it is held down. Releasing the button starts the sequence again. Conversely, if the sequencer is stopped, then holding the button down starts the sequence, and releasing stops it again.

The RUN output gate will be high when the sequence is running, and low when stopped.

The sequence is reset to restart at the beginning of the phrase pattern every time the sequencer starts. A 1 ms trigger is also sent to the RESET output.

If you want to pause the sequencer, and then pick up where you left off without resetting, then externally mute the incoming clock instead of stopping the sequencer.

The run state is preserved across sessions, and stored with each patch and preset. If the module is running when inserted or loaded, then it will immediately perform a reset and begin running.

### RESET

Pressing the RESET button or sending a CV trigger to the RESET input arms the sequencer to perform a reset and restart the phrase pattern from the beginning. The RESET button will glow brightly while in an armed state. By default the reset action will wait until the leading edge of the next 24 ppqn clock. For typical tempos, a 24 ppqn clock is fast enough that the reset is perceived as nearly instantaneous. The module context menu has a Reset Timing option where you can specify a different value for when the reset is applied:
- Clock (24 ppqn)
- Bar
- 1/2
- 1/4
- 1/8
- 1/16
- 1/32
- 1/2 Triplet
- 1/4 Triplet
- 1/8 Triplet
- 1/16 Triplet
- 1/32 Triplet

A 1 ms trigger is sent to the RESET output upon every reset action.

### DICE and SEED

Pressing the DICE button or sending a CV trigger to the DICE input causes the sequencer to immediately sample a new seed value to establish a new pattern. The new seed value will not take effect until the start of the next phrase, whether due to a RESET, or reaching the end of the phrase and cycling back. The DICE button glows brightly while waiting for the new seed value to take effect. If you want the DICE to immediately take effect, then send a trigger to both the RESET and DICE inputs.

Typically the seed value is sampled from an internal RNG. Alternatively, you can provide your own unipolar CV seed value at the SEED input. The input is clamped to 0-10V. A sample and hold is used to save the seed value at the time of the dice action.

Wherever the seed value comes from, the sampled value is continuously sent to the SEED output.

The current seed value is preserved across sessions, and is saved with each patch and preset.

### PAT OFF and 0V Seed

If the PAT OFF button is activated, then the RNG will never be reseeded, so the resultant output will be constantly changing, without any pattern.

If using CV SEED input, then the same effect can be achieved by using a 0V SEED input.

Note that the internal RNG will never generate a 0V seed value.

### RAND

Normally the patterns are established by an internal RNG that has been seeded with the sampled seed value. Alternatively, any varying CV can be patched into the RAND input to override the internal RNG. Each division will sample the RAND signal at the appropriate time to establish the next "random" value to compare against the division slider threshold. Note that the seed value has no effect when using an external RAND source.

If the RAND input is monophonic, then all divisions will sample the same RAND input. But if you provide a polyphonic input with 8 channels, then each division will get its own "random" input. Note that if you patch a polyphonic input with fewer than 8 channels, then the missing channels will get constant 0V.

The result when using external RAND may or may not have a pattern, depending on the RAND signal. You may be able to patch the Rhythm Explorer PHRASE START output to your random source reset or sync input to establish a pattern that repeats at the beginning of each phrase.

### BAR and PHRASE

The BAR knob sets the number of 1/4 notes that make up 1 bar or measure, with a value ranging from 1 to 16. The PHRASE knob sets the number of bars that make up one phrase, also with a range from 1 to 16. Upon completion of a phrase, the sequencer cycles back to the beginning of bar 1, and the pattern is reset. Each knob has a set of 16 lights above to show both the current count setting, as well as where in the cycle the sequencer is at.

Both BAR and PHRASE can be modulated via bipolar CV at the inputs below the knobs, which is added to the knob value. The scale is linear, with 0V representing 1, and 10V representing 16. The result is clamped to 0 - 10V (1 - 16 count).

### BAR START and PHRASE START

The BAR START output issues a high gate lasting one 24 ppqn clock pulse at the start of every bar. Likewise the PHRASE START output issues a gate at the start of each phrase.

The phrase start pulse is also sent to channel 9, and the bar start pulse to channel 10 of the GLOBAL polyphonic clock output.

### 8 Division Matrix

There is a matrix with 8 columns, each column representing a single division. Each division column consists of a mixture of controls, inputs, and outputs arrayed vertically. The behaviour of each control/input/output is the same for each division.

#### DIVISION Button

The square division button at the top of each column indicates the currently selected division value for that column. Pressing the button cycles through the 10 available values, and right clicking presents a menu allowing you to directly select one of the values. The available values are
- 1/2 Note
- 1/4 Note
- 1/8 Note
- 1/16 Note
- 1/32 Note
- 1/2 Note Triplet
- 1/4 Note Triplet
- 1/8 Note Triplet
- 1/16 Note Triplet
- 1/32 Note Triplet

Note that sometimes you may want to reuse the same division for multiple columns. Also note that the order of the columns can make a difference in the result depending on the mode selection (described later)

#### DENSITY Slider
Each slider specifies a threshold at which any given division beat is likely to issue a high gate. Typically the values are unipolar ranging from 0 to 100%. Each density can be modulated by the division density CV input, and/or the Global density CV input.

The density slider knob blinks bright yellow each time the beat fires for that division. Note that the mode logic used for OR, XOR ODD, and XOR 1 outputs can be different then what is used for the individual division outputs, so the blinking sliders may not match the OR, XOR ODD, or XOR 1 outputs.

#### MODE Button
The mode can influence whether a given beat will fire. Pressing the square button cycles through the available values, and right clicking provides a menu to directly select any one value.
- ALL - All beats that meet the random threshold will fire. Note that the left most division is fixed at ALL because it cannot be influenced by any other divisions.
- LIN - Linear mode, meaning that the beat will be blocked if one of the divisions to its left is firing at the same time. If all divisions are set to LIN (disregarding the 1st one of course), then there will never be more than one division playing at a time, the definition of linear drumming.
- OFF - Offbeat mode, meaning that the beat will be blocked if one of the divisions to the left coincides with this division's beat, regardless whether the left division actually fires or not. This is a special case of linear drumming. For example, if division 1 is 1/4 note, and division 2 is 1/8 note with OFF mode, then the 1/8 will never fire with the 1/4 beats - it will fire only on the "and" of each beat.
- --- Global default, meaning the division will inherit the mode that is specified at the global level.
- ALL - RESET (dashed square bracket) - Same as ALL, except the linear and offbeat computations are reset such that divisions to the left do not effect linear or offbeat divisions to the right.
- ALL - NEW (solid square bracket) - Same as ALL - RESET, except an additional channel is added to the OR, XOR ODD, and XOR 1 outputs, and this division and those to the right are assigned to the new channel.

The mode can be overridden by division Mode CV.

#### MUTE Button

Pressing the mute button toggles between muting and unmuting the division GATE output. Note that a muted division will never block any division to the right that is set to LIN mode. There is no mute CV - use the density CV if you need to effectively mute via CV.

#### DENS CV input

This bipolar CV input modulates the division density at a rate of 10% per volt. It is additive with the density sliders and the global density CV. The sum of slider plus global CV is clamped to 0-10V prior to adding the division CV, so a CV of -10V is guaranteed to effectively mute the division.

#### MODE CV input

The division mode CV input overrides the value set by the button. The CV actually sets the column's mode button to match so you get a visual indicator of the active mode.

The mode values are as follows:
- 0V = ALL
- 1V = LIN (linear)
- 2V = OFF (offbeat)
- 3V = --- (global default)
- 4V = ALL - RESET
- 5V = ALL - NEW

The CV value is rounded to the nearest integer, and clamped to be within the valid range.

#### CLOCK output

Each division outputs an appropriately divided clock division for that division. Each clock pulse has a length of one 24 ppqn clock pulse. Each division clock is also sent to one channel in the GLOBAL CLOCK poly output.

#### GATE output

For each issued beat, a gate is sent to the GATE output with length of one 24 ppqn clock pulse. Each division gate is also sent to one channel in the GLOBAL GATE poly output.

### GLOBAL Column

To the right of the 8 division matrix is a global column that can serve multiple purposes

#### GLOBAL MODE Button
The global mode has the same values as the division mode, except there are no --- (global default), ALL - RESET, or ALL - NEW values available.

The global mode serves two purposes:
- It defines the mode used to compute the OR, XOR ODD, and XOR 1 outputs.
- If a given division has its mode set to --- (Gobal Default), then the global value also defines the mode for that division.

#### GLOBAL MUTE Button
The global mute button mutes all the division gate outputs, as well as the OR, XOR ODD, and XOR 1 outputs. Each press toggles between muting and unmuting the outputs.

#### GLOBAL DENS CV
The global density CV can modulate the density for all divisions. If the input is monophonic, then the value is applied to all divisions. If the input is polyphonic, then each channel is directed to the appropriate division. The global CV can be bipolar, with each volt representing 10%. The global CV value is summed with the division density slider value and then clamped to a valid range before any division CV is applied.

#### GLOBAL MODE CV
The global mode CV overides the global button mode value. If monophonic, then it is applied to all divisions. If polyphonic then each channel is directed to the appropriate division mode. The only way to have different modes for divisions used in the OR output is via the GLOBAL MODE CV. Note that channel 1 is for the first (left most) division, even though the 1st division does not have mode CV input - it simply ignores any value there.

The voltage values are the same as for the Division Mode CV input, except the value is capped at 2V.

The Global Mode CV updates the value of the Global Mode button, showing the value that is assigned to channel 1. You can see the global modes that are assigned to all 8 divisions by hovering over the Global Mode button.

#### GLOBAL CLOCK output
The global clock output is polyphonic with 10 channels
- Channels 1 through 8 are for the clocks for divisions 1 through 8
- Channel 9 is for the Phrase Start clock
- Channel 10 is for the Bar Start clock

#### GLOBAL GATE output
The global gate output is polyphonic with 8 channels, one for each division.

### DENSITY Slider Polarity switch
The vertical slider switch controls whether the division density sliders are unipolar from 0% to 100%, or bipolar from -100% to 100%

Normally the sliders are set to unipolar. But if controlling the density via CV, then you may want to manually modulate the density up or down during performance, hence the bipolar mode.

When in normal unipolar mode, the sum of the slider value and global value is clamped to a range of 0 to 100 before being added with the division CV input.

But when in bipolar mode, the slider and global sum is clamped to a range of -100 to 100 before being added with the division CV input. Only then is the final density value clamped to a range of 0 to 100.

### DENSITY INIT Button
The density Init button will reset all division density sliders to 0%

### LOCK button
The Lock button will lock the division values, division and global modes, and the density polarity to their current values so as to prevent inadvertant changes while manipulating the density sliders during a performance.

### OR, XOR ODD, and XOR 1 summed outputs

In addition to the individual division gate outputs, there are three outputs where the individual division gates are combined into one stream of gates.

The OR output simply combines all gates, with simultaneous beats across two divisions resulting in one beat.

The XOR ODD output only allows the beat through if there are an odd number of simultaneous beats. An even number of simultaneous beats effectively cancel each other out.

The XOR 1 output only allows a beat through if there is only one beat across all divisions - all simultaneous beats are blocked.

In addition, the GLOBAL MODE further defines which beats are allowed through, using the same logic as for the individual gates. Note that if all the global modes are set to linear or offbeat mode, then the OR, XOR ODD, and XOR 1 will all emit identical patterns since by definition, those modes don't allow simultaneous beats.

These outputs are normally monophonic, combining the beats of all 8 divisions. But the outputs become polyphonic if one or more divisions are assigned ALL - NEW mode. The total number of channels equals 1 + the number of ALL - NEW modes.

### Factory Preset

There is a Vermona randomRHYTHM preset available that configures the Rhythm Explorer to make it easy to get a flavor of what it would be like to actually use the Vermona hardware. The Phrase is set to 1 and Bar to 4, like the Vermona 4/4 time. It configures the divisions as 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/4T, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/4T. All divisions are assigned mode ALL except division 5 is assigned ALL - NEW. It also sets the Global Mode to Offset so the OR output will behave like the Vermona. In this way there are effectively two rhythm generators configured like the Vermona, exept they both share a common clock, dice, and reset. The OR output is polyphonic - an external split module is needed to separate the OR output into separate outputs for each rhythm generator. 

### Bypass
All outputs are monophonic 0V when the module is bypassed.

## WINCOMP
![WINCOMP module image](./doc/WinComp.PNG)  
A windowed comparator inspired by the VCV Fundamental COMPARE module, based on specs originally proposed at 
https://community.vcvrack.com/t/vcv-compare-gates-logic-and-process/17828/17?u=davevenom.

### Polyphony
WINCOMP is fully polyphonic - the number of output channels is the maximum number of channels found across all three inputs.
Monophonic inputs are replicated to match the number of output channels. Polyphonic inputs that have fewer channels use 0V for missing channels.

### Inputs with Offsets
- **A** = A input, with OFFSET knob
- **B** = B input, with OFFSET knob
- **TOL** = Tolerance, with OFFSET knob. The tolerance specifies how close A must be to B in order to be considered equal.
The absolute value of TOL is used in all computations.
The tolerance affects all outputs except MIN and MAX.

Each input is summed with the corresponding OFFSET value. The OFFSETS are bipolar +/-10V. The resultant values are unconstrained.

### Signal Outputs

- **MIN** = Minimum output - the instantaneous minimum of the A and B inputs. TOL does not affect MIN.
- **MAX** = Maximum output - the instantaneous maximum of the A and B inputs. TOL does not affect MAX.
- **CLAMP** = A clamped to within B +/- TOL
- **OVER** = The overflow (positive or negative) from the CLAMP operation, computed as A - CLAMP.

Each of the signal output ports have context menu options to take the absolute value and or invert the output. The absolute value operation is performed prior to the inversion, so the output is guaranteed to be <=0V if both absolute value and invert are enabled.

A glowing green light in the lower left corner of the port indicates the output has the absolute value option enabled.
A glowing red light in the lower right corner indicates the output has the invert option enabled.

### Gate Outputs

- **A==B** = This gate is high if A is within B +/- TOL. OVER will be 0V when A==B is high. Computed as |A-B| <= |TOL|
- **A<>B** = This gate is high if A is not within B +/- TOL. OVER will be non-zero when A<>B is high. Computed as |A-B| > |TOL|
- **A<=B** = This gate is high if A is less than or equal to B +/- TOL. Computed as A < B + |TOL|
- **A>=B** = This gate is high if A is greater than or equal to B +/- TOL. Computed as A > B - |TOL|
- **A<B** = This gate is high if A is less than B +/- TOL. Computed as A < B - |TOL|
- **A>B** = This gate is high if A is greater than B +/- TOL. Computed as A > B + |TOL|

Each gate output has a small light in the lower right corner that glows yellow when the gate is high and the ouput is monophonic.
The light glows blue if the output is polyphonic and at least one channel is high.

The gate high and low values are 0V and 10V by default. The module context menu includes an option to specify any of the following alternate values
- 0,1
- +/-1
- 0,5
- +/-5
- 0,10
- +/-10

### Oversampling
By default WINCOMP is configured to output CV values, without any anti-aliasing. But if producing audio output, then the output may have unacceptable aliasing artifacts. The context menu has an option to enable oversampling to greatly reduce aliasing in audio outputs. The oversampling applies to all the outputs, including gate outputs.

Oversampling uses significant CPU, so there are multiple options to choose from: x2, x4, x8, and x16. The higher the oversample rate, the better the result, but more CPU is used.

An LED glows blue above the output ports if oversampling is enabled. The LED is black when oversampling is off.

### Bypass
All outputs are monophonic 0V if the module is bypassed.

## VCO
### Incomplete - Work in progress
![VCO module image](./doc/VenomVCO.png)  
A VCO derived from 21kHz Palm Loop code. VCO is one of two hidden modules that may never be released. Never-the-less, you may try it out by following the instructions at the [Hidden Unreleased Module](#hidden-unreleased-module) section.

The Palm Loop is the only existing VCO I have found that can do true through zero linear FM (not phase modulation), with the negative frequencies properly reflected, and decent anti-aliasing, even with negative frequencies, all with low CPU usage. It uses an unusual (in VCV world anyway) polyBlamp method for antialiasing the triangle wave. Bogaudio and VCV VCOs can also do through zero linear FM with 0Hz carrier, except the negative frequencies are flawed - the negative frequency antialiasing is broken for both, and the Bogaudio saw becomes unipolar at negative frequencies.

The limitations I find for Palm Loop are:
- Sine and Square (and sine sub) are 1 octave down from the saw and sine. This is a result of how the signals are computed - the saw functions as a phasor to drive the other wave forms 1 octave down.
- The subs are not properly reset
- No pulse width modulation

I have adapted the code with the following improvements:
- All wave forms are at the same octave.
- Added pulse width modulation, with an attempt to eliminate DC offset
- Added a -1 octave which runs at 0Hz so the VCO can be used conveniently as a 0 Hz carrier for linear FM. In this mode, the Pitch knob and V/Oct input serve to bias the 0 Hz carrier, giving motion to the FM
- Modified the phase relationships between the waveforms to better suit some of my patching needs.
- Not an improvement - but I swapped in stock components for the 21kHz knobs and ports. I still need to work on the faceplate layout. For example, I need to add a PWM attenuverter.

Current Bugs:
- Triangle antialising works just fine until it reaches ~1/4 the Nyquist frequency, at which point all hell breaks loose. I've tested at multiple sample rates, and there is definitely something going on with the math, but I do not understand the polyBLAMP, so I don't know how to fix it. The breakdowns occur at:
  - 48 kHz at around 6,040 Hz
  - 96 kHz at around 12,080 Hz
  - 192 kHz at around 24,160 Hz
- Square wave antialiasing works just fine as long as PW is at 50%. But the moment PW deviates the antialiasing goes to hell, which I think also introduces DC offset. I am pretty sure the DC offset problem will be eliminated if I can figure out the anti-aliasing problem. Again, I don't understand the math, so I don't know how to fix it.

Assuming I can resolve the aliasing problems, I would like to add the following features:
- polyphony - I will need to start using simd to maintain decent performance
- If possible, I would like to add independent phase control for each waveform
- I may also add a mixer with inversion capabilities to simplify creation of complex waveforms.

The last two options could be build in, added through an expander, or possibly another module.
